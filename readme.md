# Sentiment Analysis web-app in Flask
This web app is built on custom [Setfit](https://huggingface.co/StatsGary/setfit-ft-sentinent-eval) sentiment analysis model, where the base model is from `Hugging Face Transformers library` and later custom trained on the `twitter sentiment dataset` for custom class response.

## Model training
As github doesn't support large files normally, the trained model folder is not uploaded. However, running the `model.py` file in the `model` folder would create a directory called `miniLM` which will contain the trained model. You can modify the parameters for training.

```cmd
python model.py
```

*This has to be run only once for creating the model and the miniLM folder.*

## Web-App
Running the `app.py` file would start the flask server at port 5000. Simply go to [http://127.0.0.1:5000/prediction](http://127.0.0.1:5000/prediction) for the web UI, where entering any text would print the sentiment output as positive/negative/neutral on the page.

```cmd
python app.py
```

## Testing API endpoint in *Postman*
To check the API in postman, another endpoint at [http://127.0.0.1:5000/analyze](http://127.0.0.1:5000/analyze) was created. This simply took a json input in the body as raw json data, and returned the sentiment as json output.

```py
# input
{
    "text" : "Today is a boring day"
}

# ouput
{
    "sentiment" : "Negative"
}
```

There is also the `predict.py` file which can send request to the "/analyze" directory and print the sentiment output.
